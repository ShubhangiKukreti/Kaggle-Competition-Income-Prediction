# Kaggle-Competition-Income-Prediction

I have used Bayesian Ridge to predict the income based on various input values.

The training data is stored in file 'training-data-with-labels.csv'
The test data is stored in file 'test-data-without-labels.csv'.

The output is stored in 'tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction submission file.csv'
